[^1]: Only use SMS 2FA when it is the only 2FA option available. When possible, use Time-base One Time Password (TOTP) options such as those provided by 1Password, Google Authenticator, or Authy. I personally recommend [1Password](https://1password.com/features/two-factor-authentication/), as it can autofill usernames, passwords, and OTP 2FA codes.
